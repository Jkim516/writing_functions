## Q1: Calculate moving average

You are a given a list of numbers `J` and a single number `p`.

Write a function to return the minimum and maximum averages of the sequences of `p` numbers in `J`.

### Example

```
J = [4, 4, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12]
p = 3
```

The sequences will be:

```
(4, 4, 4)
(4, 4, 9)
(4, 9, 10)
(9, 10, 11)
(10, 11, 12)
```

The minimum average will be 4 and the maximum average will be 11, which corresponds to the first ande last sequences.
